The "Horiseon" website (below) was provide to me to improve the HTML and CSS files.

## Code Refaction
### Links and Images
A couple of links were broken.
Most images were missing alternative descriptions.

### HTML
Semantic layouts have been incorperated.

### CSS
There was a lot of duplication within the CSS file, apply the DRY (don't repeat yourself) approached reduced the lines of code by almost half.

## General
Added comments to explain the code.
